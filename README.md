# Jordan and Scotty

This is a single webpage style tribute to Michael Jordan. Just practicing some stuff here.

## Todo
- [] Practice building this in HTML as fast as I can
- [] Practice building this in Markdown as fast as I can
- [] Practice building this in Jade as fast as I can


## Setting up the project
1. Open this project in Atom and your terminal
2. In your terminal run
	- `git init` then
	- `git status` then
	- `git add .` then
	- `git status` then  
	- `git commit -m 'Initial commit'`
	- `git status` then
3. Then go to GitHub and create a repo called `jordan-tribute`
4. Follow the instructions from GitHub to "push and existing git repo"
5. Create a new branch called mike `gcob mike`
6. Push that branch `git push`
7. Run `npm install`
8. Go to gitHub and include `gandhishepard` to the repo

### Fire it up
Open project in the Terminal and run `gulp`. That's it!

### Gulp
The gulpfile will:
- pre-process stylus into CSS
- automatically launch the brower with your project in Chrome Canary
- automatically refresh the browser on save
- make a list of your TODOs by running `gulp todo`
